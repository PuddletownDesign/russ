#Basic HTML 

First off keep a detailed text file of all of your notes. Make sure to include things like:

1. Best practices
2. Keyboard shortcuts
3. Code Snippets
4. Workflow

Not only is it handy for reference, but for me at least helps me remember and be more methodical. Your notes are your documentation. Try to keep them organized and separated by section. Text editor stuff, HTML, the task, how you did it, shit like that.

------------------------------------------

Format a the following document in valid HTML using the following tags. Do not concern yourself with how it looks if you preview it. 

* h1-h6
* p
* ul
* ol
* li
* blockquote
* cite

-------------------------------------------

##helpful tips

1. I use a keyboard shortcut to select whole areas of text or multiple lines and then wrap them with tags.

2. Headers
	* h1 - top level page header, there should only be one. every page should have one.
	* h2-h6 - these are sub headings.

3. Every list needs to have a header

4. the cite tag can only be used inside the blockquote tag

5. type all tags in lowercase

6. ordered lists (ol) are for items that go in an order. unordered lists (ul) are more general and in no particular order.
