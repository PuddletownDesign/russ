## HTML 1.2

Now we gonna get you up to speed wrapping tags for formatting. 

## Task

Format the 3 following files

* cats-wiki.html
* index2.html

**Wait to do this one until we get the `surround` vim plugin working.**

I've left the original corrected index.html file in place for you to reference.

Then work on speed editing these documents by wrapping and using the correct tags
