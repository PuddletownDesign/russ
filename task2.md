# Git 1.2

## Task

So I've renamed all the branches so far. To look better and to be a pain in the ass. You're going to have to `pull --all` and then check each one out again locally instead of making them. Use the same names I've created and assigned.

Then push them back one at a time the same way you have been doing it. One at a time.

## Create better documentation

Keep a better updated list of git commands in the readme.md. I've added some of mine. You keep filling this out as you go along. It's really important to have a reference on hand.
