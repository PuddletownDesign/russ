## Basic HTML:

### best practices
        * wrap document in <html><body></body></html>
        * all pages have headers; <h1-h?>, <h1> is main header, should be only 1 per page.
        * some tags must be nested inside other tags (i.e. <cite> must be inside <blockquotes>)
        * <ol> is for ordered lists, <ul> is for unordered lists (think numbers vs. bullet points)
        * <li> works as list elements for both <ol> and <ul>
        * every list needs to have a header
        * all tags should be lowercase
        * don't wrap lists w/ headers; headers should be above list
        * wrap paragraphs of text with the "<p></p>" tag
        * <p> for paragraph inside <blockquote> <cite> inside <blockquote>
                * indent nested block level tag
### keyboard shortcuts
        * write keyboard shortcuts for wrapping elements with tags in Vim
### code snippets
        * templates including common elements
### workflow
        * wrap selected text with html tags using hotkeys (have yet to implement)
### markdown
        * this document is formatted using markdown
