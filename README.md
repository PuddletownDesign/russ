*Working with Git*

*1. Create a github account*

http://github.com

*2. Register your SSH keys with git *

so no login is needed.

Here's a guide:

https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/

You will learn the basics of SSH doing this. SSH is used to connect to a command prompt on servers.

*3. clone the existing repo*

I'll send you a repository link. You figure out how to clone the repo to a directory on your machine to work with.

*4. Push the files we made to gihhub*

you add the existing files that we made to the directory and push it back to github as a branch. Name the branch 1-learning-git and push that back to github.

*5. Pull down the new changes once I merge them on my side (I'll let you know)*

You'll want to update your local version once I make changes to the remote version. You'll use the pull command for this.
