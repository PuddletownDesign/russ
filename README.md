## Things to look out for

Keep taking and organizing more notes. Gotta keep a solid reference for yourself through this. All of these readme files are lacking a little bit. Keep the markdown notepad open!

I've made each of these into a trello task. Check em off as you go along.

## Tasks

### 01-git

Well I've renamed all the branches... You gonna have to deal with that. Protip: you can just delete the old ones in this case. However you have to pull and rebranch them all.
