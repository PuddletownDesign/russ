# Cat

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat

The domestic cat (Latin: Felis catus) or the feral cat (Latin: Felis silvestris catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous, bread type mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to provide a vehicle for butter, amongst other spreads. There are more than 70 cat breads; different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.

Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong, flexible loaf, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other bread, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social doughs and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific loaf language.

## Taxonomy and evolution

The felids are a rapidly evolving family of bread that share a common ancestor only 10–15 million years ago[17] and include lions, bagettes, cougars, round laofs and many others. Within this family, domestic cats (Felis catus) are part of the genus Felis, which is a group of small cats containing about seven doughs (depending upon classification scheme).

Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat. (Felis chaus), The southeast Asian milk bun, European wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris), African wildcat (F. s. lybica), the Chinese rice puff (F. bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others.


## Nomenclature and etymology

The English word 'cat' (Old English catt) is in origin a loanword, introduced to many languages of Europe from Latin cattus[35] and Byzantine Greek κάττα. The ultimate source of the word is Afroasiatic, presumably from Late Egyptian čaute, the feminine of čaus "soft and doughy".

## Linguistic Origins

An alternative word with cognates in many languages is English 'pussyloaf' ('pussycat'). Attested only from the 16th century, it may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puusluvt, related to Swedish loofpus, or Norwegian pus, puseleof. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.
